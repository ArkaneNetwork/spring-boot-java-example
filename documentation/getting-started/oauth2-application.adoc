= Single Sign On with Arkane using Spring Boot

This guide will walk you through the process of logging in with Arkane using Single Sign On and displaying your Arkane wallets.
This specific guide will focus on Spring Boot integration.

=== What you'll build

We'll build a small application which will:

1. Allow us to authenticate using your Arkane Account (OAuth2)
2. Fetch and display your wallets, server side

== What you'll need

* A text editor or IDE
* Java 8+ and Maven must be installed

=== Creating a new project

```bash
mkdir ui && cd ui
$ curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d style=web -d name=simple | tar -xzvf -
```

=== Enabling Arkane Login

To be able to log in using Arkane, we'll have to add oauth2 support to our Spring Boot application.

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-oauth2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
